## What did I use to make this skill?


The Alexa Skills Kit 

AWS Lambda: This is where the backend is hosted. Instead of using a server that runs all the time, I use AWS Lambdawhich is a Function-as-a-service (FaaS) It get's called only when invoked by a user. It's serverless for me. The cost to host is almost zero and will be minimal unless there are 1 million+ requests.

Boto3 AWS SDK: to interact with  

Reddit PRAW API: To get the updated stats

Some regex to parse

Amazon Dynamo DB: to store how many times a user invokes this skill.
